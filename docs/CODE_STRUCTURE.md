## Core Packages Explained

### `core/` — The Kingdom's Foundation

This is where the bedrock of the kingdom lives. **Do not modify anything here** — these files are maintainer-only.

| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `KingdomEntity.java` | The master interface every building must implement |
| `EntityStatus.java` | Enum representing building states: `OPERATIONAL`, `DAMAGED`, `DESTROYED` |
| `KingdomRegistry.java` | Tracks all registered entity types in the kingdom |

Every entity you build will implement `KingdomEntity` (through its abstract contract). Think of it as the building permit every structure in the kingdom must carry.

---

### `contracts/` — The Quest Blueprints

Each weekly quest introduces new abstract contracts here. These define the **minimum requirements** your building must meet — the methods you're required to implement.

```
contracts/
├── AbstractBarracks.java     # "Build something that can train troops"
├── AbstractBlacksmith.java   # "Build something that can forge weapons"
├── AbstractMarket.java       # "Build something that manages trade"
└── AbstractLumberyard.java   # Already implemented — see entities/
```

Contracts are intentionally sparse. They tell you *what* to implement, not *how*. Your design choices determine your score.

---

### `entities/` — Where Your Work Lives

This is where merged implementations go. Every file here was written by a contributor and won the quest for their week.

```
entities/
├── Lumberyard.java     # Reference implementation — read this first!
└── Farm.java           # Week 01 merged implementation
```

**Your goal:** add your class here by winning the weekly quest.

---

### `test/` — Proving Your Code Works

Every entity in `entities/` has a corresponding test file here. Tests must pass for a PR to be considered.

```
test/
├── LumberyardTest.java     # Reference test — shows you exactly what's expected
└── FarmTest.java
```

Study `LumberyardTest.java` before writing your own tests — it covers every pattern you'll need.

---

## The Layering Rule

The packages are designed to follow a strict dependency direction:

```
core/  ←  contracts/  ←  entities/
```

- `core` knows nothing about `contracts` or `entities`
- `contracts` may depend on `core` only
- `entities` may depend on `core` and `contracts`

**Never import an `entities/` class from inside a `contracts/` file.** This breaks the layering and teaches backwards dependency — a real anti-pattern in professional Java.
