## 🎯 The Essentials

### 1. Choose Your Entity
- **Lumberyard**: Master of wood harvesting and resource management
- **Barracks**: Commander of training and troop deployment
- **Blacksmith**: Keeper of forging and weapon craftsmanship
- **Market**: Merchant of trade and commerce

### 2. Implement with Excellence
- Extend the abstract class: `public class Lumberyard extends AbstractLumberyard`
- Implement all abstract methods with custom logic
- Use `@JsonProperty` annotations on all fields
- Initialize defaults safely in your constructor (UUID-based identities recommended)
- Register your class: `static { KingdomRegistry.register(Lumberyard.class); }`

### 3. Test Thoroughly
```bash
mvn clean test
```
- Write comprehensive unit tests
- Test Jackson serialization/deserialization
- Verify your entity integrates with CityHall and Farm

### 4. Include UML Diagram
Document your class hierarchy and relationships using Mermaid:
```mermaid
classDiagram
  KingdomEntity <|-- AbstractLumberyard
  AbstractLumberyard <|-- Lumberyard
```

### 5. Follow Naming Conventions
- **Class**: `Lumberyard.java` (PascalCase)
- **Test**: `LumberyardTest.java` (PascalCase + Test)
- **Methods**: `harvestWood()`, `getWoodStockpile()` (camelCase)
- **Fields**: `woodStockpile`, `harvestRate` (camelCase, all @JsonProperty)
